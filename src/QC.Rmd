# Set-up
```{r}
library(here) # for reproducible paths
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(scater) # For qc
```
```{r}
sce <- readRDS(here("processed", "sce.RDS"))
```

# Gene QC
We start by removing genes not expressed in any cell
```{r}
genes_beforeqc <- dim(sce)[1]
keep_feature <- rowSums(counts(sce) > 0) > 0
sce <- sce[keep_feature, ]
genes_beforeqc -dim(sce)[1] 
```
